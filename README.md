Project: E-Commerce Customer Personalisation Analytics

Overview
This project applies data analytics techniques to analyse customer behaviour and support data-driven personalisation strategies in an e-commerce context. Using transactional retail data, the analysis explores customer segmentation, retention patterns, product affinity, and predictive identification of high-value customers.

Key Techniques

RFM analysis and customer segmentation (K-means clustering)

Cohort-based customer retention analysis

Market basket analysis (association rules)

Predictive modelling for high-value customer identification

Key Insights

A small proportion of customers contribute a disproportionate share of revenue

Customer engagement declines sharply after initial purchase cohorts

Stable co-purchase patterns suggest opportunities for bundled promotions

Purchase frequency is a strong predictor of high-value customers

Tools
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
